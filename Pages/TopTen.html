                        <p>The Conjuring is one of the scariest films of all time. Let's revisit the horrors behind this macabre and frightening story.
                            Ed and Lorraine Warren are famous paranormal investigators who have confronted several supernatural cases and are seeking their respective solutions. This story brings to light the Perron family who are being terrorized by a demonic entity and ask the couple for help to get rid of this problem before the worst happens.<br>
                            
                            
                             <br>CURIOSITIES:<br>
                            - The Warren couple and the events are real, they are both deceased but they had a daughter who has the same gifts as her mother.
                            <br>- The couple has explored more than 4 thousand supernatural cases since the 1950s.
                            <br>- Eight generations had lived and died in the residence with approximately 80 thousand hectares of land, all deaths occurred in terrible circumstances marked by murders, rapes and suicides.
                            <br>- The situation in the house worsened when the spirit of Bathsheba Sherman tortured and possessed the body of the Perron family's mother.  Bathsheba was supposedly a Satanist witch who killed a baby and hanged herself behind the barn.
                            <br>- One of the Perron daughters supported the production of the film by telling us what they experienced in the house but emphasizes that the film takes it easy in relation to what the family really suffered.
                            <br>- Some people from the film's production reported some kind of supernatural experience and even Lorraine Warren herself who was there said this too.
                            <br>- At the end of the film Lorraine tells Ed that a priest called for the two of them to check out a case on Long Island which, interestingly enough, is the terrible Amityville house whose story is briefly told at the beginning of "The Conjuring 2".<br>
