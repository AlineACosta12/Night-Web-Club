                                    Hey there! I am Aline<br>
                                    <br>I am a funny and determined girl who finds joy in every moment. Am I stubborn?
                                    Well,
                                    let's just say once I set my mind to something, there's no stopping me.<br>
                                    <br>Movies and series? Oh, I am all about them! There's nothing quite like getting
                                    lost
                                    in a gripping storyline or sharing a good laugh over a comedy with friends. It is my
                                    go-to way to unwind and escape reality for a while.<br>
                                    <br>Speaking of friends, they are everything to me. Hanging out with them is my
                                    favourite pastime. Whether we are exploring new places, having deep conversations,
                                    or
                                    simply goofing around, every moment spent with them is pure gold.<br>
                                    <br>So, if you ever need someone to crack a joke, tackle a challenge head-on,
                                    binge-watch a series, or just chill with, I am your person. Life is too short not to
                                    laugh, learn, and cherish the moments we share with friends. Let's make the most of
                                    it
                                    together!

                                <h2>Eros - 3151957</h2>
                                <p><br>I am an international student at Griffith College Cork coming originally from
                                    Brazil.
                                    My country has quite a lot of proud members living in Ireland, though I am,
                                    unfortunately or not, not one of them. I love Ireland and all the rest of Europe and
                                    wish to travel through all the countries I can. I do not care for warm weather and
                                    beaches, preferring much more the cold and occasional rain of the Emerald Isles. I
                                    am currently studying Computing Science, which is, of course, a fascinating field,
                                    however, I am still not entirely sure this is what I want to do for life; my
                                    aspiration has
                                    always been to be part of the academic world, lecturing on high level education
                                    institutions, being a scholar, and I am not as well versed in technology as someone
                                    my age should be, though I have a good enough grasp of the concepts seen in class so
                                    far.<br>
                                    <br>For my free time and leisure, I am not for drinking and dancing, rather playing
                                    games with friends or simply going somewhere to talk and make jokes. I would say my
                                    favourite past time and hobby is TTRPGs, most specifically the game Vampire the
                                    Masquerade; there are dozens of books, comic books and electronic games about this
                                    universe, and honestly there are few things that entertain me as much as this.<br>
                                    <br>I am someone who doesn't like to have many friends, but a selected few with whom
                                    I feel extremely comfortable. I may be difficult to deal with sometimes, some of my
                                    friends complain when I don't take things seriously, or make too many jokes, and I
                                    appreciate having people to bring me back to reality when my mind wanders too
                                    far.<br>

                                <p> <br>My name is Sergio, and I am from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I have been living in
                                    Ireland
                                    for two years to improve my English, which I consider essential for my life and
                                    career.
                                    I like making friends and sharing experiences because it is an excellent way to
                                    enhance
                                    knowledge, from my point of view.<br>
                                    <br>Previously, I graduated in marketing, but unfortunately, it didn't work as
                                    planned
                                    in my career in Brazil. I decided here in Ireland to start my second undergraduate
                                    degree in a different subject to extract new skills because I love learning new
                                    things
                                    and turning my ideas into something real.<br>
                                    <br>I am optimistic, sincere, patient, anxious, dreamy and attentive. I also like to
                                    help people somehow because I believe our mission is to look after the next; doing
                                    small
                                    things can make a difference in our lives or someone else's. In my spare time, I
                                    love
                                    watching movies, playing video games, reading comic books, travelling and going out
                                    with
                                    friends. I love the entertainment world, and one of my dreams is to work with film
                                    productions. I believe I will do so someday in the future.<br>
